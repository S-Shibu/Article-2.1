<p>This article discusses the methods in which Artificial Intelligence is used today in applications such as virtual reality and other wearable technology. It talks about the ways AI uses automation and machine learning to implement prevention in hacking and improving virtual reality. This article also mentions the importance of governing and cautious engineering required for solid infrastructure in the infancy of AI.

<p>I think AI will be very helpful in the VR and Wearable Tech industry. These are industries that not only influence the gaming world but also medical facilities and methods. AI can fix or predict human error in fields such as this. I expect AI to be implemented in every aspect of daily life like well-being, screentime, exercise, etc. Eventually you would have micro-technology with AI implementation, people with virtual reality built into their glasses. AI is still in its infancy and even now there are huge leaps in it everyday.
